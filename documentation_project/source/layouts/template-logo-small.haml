  This template is suitable for general pages that aren’t meant to participate
  within a group. It does show related pages followed by :seeAlso content at
  the bottom on the page, but it’s not as obvious for simple navigation as the
  template-logo-medium. It features a small version of your help logo in the
  top left, followed by the title.

Although developed for **Middlemac**, the `middlemac-extras` extension for
Middleman is a great way to add handy developer conveniences to your Middleman
project.

It serves as a truly “extra” extension that gathers utilities intended for
**MiddleMac** but are generic enough that they can be used with any Middleman
project.

This extension currently offers features such as these:

- CSS-based image sizes
- Automatic Markdown reference-style links
- Automatic Markdown reference-style images
- An enhanced `image_tag` that:
   - Automatically includes a `srcset` attribute for @2x images
   - Allows you to omit the extension for image files
   - Fixes `automatic_alt_tags` for absolute path images

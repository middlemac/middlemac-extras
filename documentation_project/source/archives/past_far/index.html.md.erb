Although developed for **MiddleMac**, the `middlemac-extras` extension for
Middleman is a great way to add handy developer conveniences to your Middleman
project.

Features such as CSS-based image sizes, automatic Markdown reference-style
links, and an automatic @2x `image_size` helper will increase your productivity.

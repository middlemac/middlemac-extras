This is a generic sample page, and it’s included in this project just to force
the helpers to have some information to demonstrate. With that, let’s have a
look at the helper output.

## `<%%= md_links %>` 

This isn't normally meant to be visible; this simply shows you the content that
would be part of your Markdown file when including this helper. You can use
these reference-style tags with Markdown, e.g., `[Home page][index]`.

<%= md_links %>

~~~ erb
<%%= md_links %>
~~~

~~~ markdown
<%= md_links %>
~~~

### Test

 
## `<%%= md_images %>`

middlemac-extras change log
===========================

- Version 1.0.1 / 2016-April-08

  - Fixed the implementation of css_image_sizes so that full path is not
    always used, as Middleman using `:relative_assets` doesn't use the full
    path.

- Version 1.0.0 / 2016-April-05

  - Initial Release

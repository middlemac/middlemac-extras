middlemac-extras change log
===========================

- Version 1.0.6 / 2016-April-08

  - If `middleman-targets` is also installed, support images without extensions
    for it, too. Make sure to active it first, though.
    
  - Added CLI topic to help file.

- Version 1.0.5 / 2016-April-08

  - Fixed the implementation of css_image_sizes so that full path is not
    always used, as Middleman using `:relative_assets` doesn't use the full
    path.

- Version 1.0.0 / 2016-April-05

  - Initial Release
